Caesar Cipher in Ruby


## Background

In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar’s cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar’s code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

## Objective

Implement a caesar cipher that takes in a string and the shift factor and then outputs the modified string.

### Description

I took this from my solution to the same problem in the CS50 course. Translating the C into ruby.
